### About Shoreline
The Shoreline platform provides real-time monitoring, alerting, and incident automation for cloud operations. Use Shoreline to detect, debug, and automate repairs across your entire fleet in seconds with just a few lines of code.

Shoreline Agents are efficient and non-intrusive processes running in the background of all your monitored hosts. Agents act as the secure link between Shoreline and your environment's Resources, providing real-time monitoring and metric collection across your fleet. Agents can execute actions on your behalf -- everything from simple Linux commands to full remediation playbooks -- running simultaneously across all the targeted Resources.

Since Agents are distributed throughout your fleet and monitor your Resources in real time, when an issue occurs Shoreline automatically alerts your team before your operators notice something is wrong. Plus, when you're ready for it, Shoreline can automatically resolve these issues using Alarms, Actions, Bots, and other Shoreline tools that you configure. These objects work in tandem to monitor your fleet and dispatch the appropriate response if something goes wrong -- you can even receive notifications via the fully-customizable Slack integration.

Shoreline Notebooks let you convert your static runbooks into interactive, annotated, sharable web-based documents. Through a combination of Markdown-based notes and Shoreline's expressive Op language, you have one-click access to real-time, per-second debug data and powerful, fleetwide repair commands.

### What are Shoreline Op Packs?
Shoreline Op Packs are open-source collections of Terraform configurations and supporting scripts that use the Shoreline Terraform Provider and the Shoreline Platform to create turnkey incident automations for common operational issues. Each Op Pack comes with smart defaults and works out of the box with minimal setup, while also providing you and your team with the flexibility to customize, automate, codify, and commit your own Op Pack configurations.

# Slow Job Execution in Spark Cluster
---

This incident type describes a situation where jobs executed in a Spark cluster are running slowly. The root cause of this problem is often due to high resource utilization and inefficient data processing. To resolve this issue, measures such as resource isolation, cluster optimization, job submission improvements, proactive monitoring, and user training are implemented to improve performance and prevent future occurrences.

### Parameters
```shell
export APPLICATION_ID="PLACEHOLDER"

export MASTER_URL="PLACEHOLDER"

export APPLICATION_JAR="PLACEHOLDER"

export CONF_KEY="PLACEHOLDER"

export CONF_VALUE="PLACEHOLDER"

export CONFIG_FILE="PLACEHOLDER"

```

## Debug

### Check the current CPU and memory usage of the Spark cluster
```shell
top
```

### Check the current disk usage of the Spark cluster
```shell
df -h
```

### Check the resource allocation and usage of the Spark cluster
```shell
yarn top
```

### Check the current Spark job queue and status
```shell
spark-submit --master ${MASTER_URL} --status ${APPLICATION_ID}
```

### Check the Spark job logs for any errors or warnings
```shell
yarn logs -applicationId ${APPLICATION_ID}
```

### Check the Spark job configuration for any inefficiencies
```shell
spark-submit --master ${MASTER_URL} --properties-file ${CONFIG_FILE} --conf ${CONF_KEY}=${CONF_VALUE} ${APPLICATION_JAR}
```

### Check the Spark job execution plan for any bottlenecks
```shell
spark-submit --master ${MASTER_URL} --conf spark.sql.execution.debug=true ${APPLICATION_JAR}
```

## Repair

### Optimize cluster configuration: Another possible solution is to optimize the configuration of the Spark cluster, such as tuning the Spark executor memory settings, or changing the number of Spark executors.
```shell


#!/bin/bash



# Set the Spark executor memory

SPARK_EXECUTOR_MEMORY="4g"



# Set the number of Spark executors

SPARK_EXECUTOR_INSTANCES="4"



# Set the number of CPU cores per Spark executor

SPARK_EXECUTOR_CORES="4"



# Stop the Spark service

sudo systemctl stop spark



# Modify the Spark configuration file

sudo sed -i "s/spark.executor.memory\s*=.*/spark.executor.memory=$SPARK_EXECUTOR_MEMORY/g" /etc/spark/conf/spark-defaults.conf

sudo sed -i "s/spark.executor.instances\s*=.*/spark.executor.instances=$SPARK_EXECUTOR_INSTANCES/g" /etc/spark/conf/spark-defaults.conf

sudo sed -i "s/spark.executor.cores\s*=.*/spark.executor.cores=$SPARK_EXECUTOR_CORES/g" /etc/spark/conf/spark-defaults.conf



# Start the Spark service

sudo systemctl start spark


```
